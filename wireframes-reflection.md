Hello Kitty Sudoku   
—————————

The main differences between my phone and desktop layouts are the size of the buttons and how certain things are scaled. The game takes up the whole width of the phone, but the desktop game takes up only half of the screen.

I did not remove or hide any UI elements, due to it being an immensely simple game, no extra features were needed nor added in the actual coded game. I did resize the logo, actual game screen, number selection, and the play, easy mode, hard mode, and exit button though.

The same UI elements fit very differently, so I had to resize them a bit.

A player's experience really won't change, it's very similar, so if a player who plays on the computer wanted to play on the phone as well, it would be a very easy transition.
