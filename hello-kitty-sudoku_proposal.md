Hello Kitty Sudoku

—-----------------------

The name of my game is Hello Kitty Sudoku, it deeply connects with the theme and the purpose of the game. All of the game art is based on the color scheme of Hello Kitty, and the challenge of the game is a remake of Sudoku.

Hello Kitty Sudoku is a 2d puzzle game, based on a fixed screen with no player movement. It consists of endless puzzles that can get more difficult based upon the mode you chose. It has a cartoonish/light art style, and the main challenge is puzzle solving. 

There is no story, or any characters, it is a standard 2d puzzle computer game.

I think many sudoku enjoyers would play my game, which tends to be not very young, but the game was inspired by a young person who likes sudoku and hello kitty. I think any age would enjoy this game but the theme would probably attract younger women (13-20) and some older people who would like the new challenge that my game brings (30-50).

Players would continue to play out of their desire to get better at the game and beat their previous attempts at beating the sudoku without any errors.

My game stands out due to its theme. It’s not a very special game, but many would find the reskin cute and intriguing.

I have tried the NY Times online sudoku game and [sudoku.com](http://sudoku.com). Mine is unique due to the theme and I prefer mine over theirs due to how you select the number that you want before you select the tile, highlighting all the tiles and making it a more enjoyable game.

Players get excited when they get numbers in the correct tiles one after the other, and then feel frustrated when they get stuck. I think the dopamine hit of getting the first few tiles correct super easily will keep them playing.
