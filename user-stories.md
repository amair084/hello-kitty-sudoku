—————————

User Story 1

Acceptance Criteria 2: The game shows examples of how to play and a short tutorial on the basics of sudoku.

User Story 2  
As a casual player, I want to choose a harder difficulty, so that I can have a more difficult challenge.

As a competitive player, I want to see my completion time, so I can try and beat my previous times.

Acceptance Criteria 1: The player is able to see his completion time when he/she beats the puzzle.

Game Designer’s Reflection  
—————————  
The difficult user story was the easiest to write due to it being a simple feature to implement, and was already in the game plans.

The tutorial user story was the hardest due to it being a difficult idea to actually incorporate and would take learning new skills to actually implement.

These ideas will give me more buttons to account for on the screen when I design the prototypes. It will take more time due to having to design the buttons but I believe it will help bring a clearer idea when it comes to actually making the screens and make it a better experience for the user.
